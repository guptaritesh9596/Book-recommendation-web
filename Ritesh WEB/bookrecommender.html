            <h1>JAVA History</h1>
            <div id="articleone">
                <p>James Gosling, often called as the father of Java pioneered Java in June 1991 as a project called ‘Oak.’ Gosling aimed to develop a virtual machine and language with a well-known notation like C but with more precision and simplicity than C/C++. In 1995, Java 1.0 was the first public execution. It pledged ‘Write Once, Run Anywhere’ on popular platforms with free runtimes. It was very safe and configurable, with security restricting network and file access. In a stable ‘applet’ setup, the significant web browsers soon implemented it in their standard settings.

                    In 1997, Sun reached out to the ISO/IEC JTC1 and then Ecma International to formalize Java, but they quickly withdrew. Java continues to be a de facto proprietary standard regulated by the Java Community Process. With the revenue generated by a new vision, such as the Java Enterprise Framework, Sun made several Java implementations free of charge. The critical difference is that the compiler is not present in the JRE, differentiating between its Software Development Kit (SDK) and JRE (JRE).</p>

            <h1>C History</h1>
            <div id="articles">
                <p>It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at the AT&T Bell Laboratories. It was developed along with the UNIX operating system, and is strongly linked with UNIX operating system. History of C language revolves around development as a system implementation language to write an operating system.</p>

            <h1>Python History</h1>
            <div id="third">
                <p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

                    In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox. 
                    The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions. </p>
